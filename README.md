# ryanwaugh.dev

My personal website dedicated to hosting any projects I may be working on.

## Main Page - [ryanwaugh.dev](https://ryanwaugh.dev)
[Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) renders an animated scene of a spinning torus knot.
  - Three.js 'extra' module provides the ASCII filter for the entire scene

## XR Subdomain - [xr.ryanwaugh.dev](https://xr.ryanwaugh.dev)

Home of my XR experimentation with [A-Frame](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/).

A-Frame `components` used:

- [aframe-extras](https://github.com/c-frame/aframe-extras) by C-Frame - _'community maintained A-Frame components'_
  - aframe-extras `hand-controls` addon allows for Quest 2 controller support (& _touch-to-move_ on mobile)
