My personal website - a homepage for any projects I might be working on.

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) renders an animated scene of a spinning torus knot
  - Three.js 'extra' module provides the ASCII filter for the entire scene
  - [aframe-extras](https://github.com/c-frame/aframe-extras) `hand-controls` addon allows for Quest 2 controller support (& _touch-to-move_ on mobile)
